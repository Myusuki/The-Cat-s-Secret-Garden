## Welcome to The Secret Garden!
Hello everyone! I'm The Cat and this blog is my Secret Garden!
This blog is going to be a blog of me being me(I'm still keeping my private life private as I have the decision to do so). 
Talking about hobbies like technology, photography, and video games; along with other topics that I might want to talk about. 
Though what I wish for this blog to be, most importantly, is to be a place where people who are curious, about things that people normally don't know or seek, meet. 
Like a library somewhat, if you will. 


As I am new to blogging I'll be experimenting a lot here. From the visual UI/UX of the blog, to my writing style in posts. 

## The Reason and History for this Blog
I've been planning to start a blog for quite some time now, but every time I did I just ended up not doing so. 
Before the blog idea came to mind I was already trying to pick up skills and other interests that took a lot of patience, which ends up with me being overwhelmed by all of it. 
Because of this I had a perfectionist mindset when it came to this blog, and it took a bit to just stop that tendency that was in the way to end up with what's happening right now: just doing it!
The tendency still for perfection still exists, but it'll be redirected and repurposed so that it doesn't get toxic and in the way of me doing things.


### Hope You Enjoy Your Stay in this Garden! Stay Curious!
